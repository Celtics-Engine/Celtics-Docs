# [Will] - [The Boston Celtics] Accomplishment Tracking

  

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

  

## Background

  

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE

career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in

handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

  

## Instructions

  

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

  

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during

the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This

should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

  

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills

laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

  

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices

* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code

* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and

 algorithms

* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality

* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics

* Contributes to planning and design

* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

  

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but

should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

  

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your

instructors by the end of the unit._
