# Celtics Engine Asset Management

## Purpose [WR]
We choose to create a full stack application in which a community of users could easily post, search, view, and upload/download asset models

# Frontend Demo 
- login page [W] 
    - register and sign in
    - show nav-bar page states while signed-in and out 
    
- asset post page [JT]
    - post an asset
    - required fields
    - show the asset is now on search page
    - click

- search/explore page [JT]
    - search page html (scaling of the images)
    - look up an asset by name 
    - click an asset to show the route to details page
    
- asset details [W]
    - download/remove button depending on auth user

- profile page [JT]
    - user assets list on profile 

- general html/css styling and layout [JT] [W] 

## Backend Demo [WR]
- auth (aws-congnito)
- navbar (single page application) 
- data model (dynamodb)
- api (graphql)
- storage (s3)

## New Skills/technologies

- angular
- aws amplify
- npm

- typescript
- html/css


## Challenges
- team communication
- transitioning from the java backend to amplify
- git merges / managing the amplify env 
- having a mess of the front-end originally (we cleaned it up though it came out great)

## What you learned
- Learning a new framework or programing language in less then a month can be challenging
