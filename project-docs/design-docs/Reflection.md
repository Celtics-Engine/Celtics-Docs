# [Celtics Engine] Reflection

## Design

Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?

- Our implementation changed once we started looking into solutions for full stack 
aplications

## Project

How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user stories?

- It took us some serious effort to figure out what was possible to accomplish
given our original idea, but we quickly adjusted to something more manageable for
the given time frame

## Scrum

Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

- keeping everyone busy with something was challenging. However, I learned a good way 
to solve this problem is to keep conversations at a high level of abstraction and leave the details up to the team member who is implementing the idea

## Looking ahead

If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently?

- Our time managment skills could use some improvement, but otherwise everyone nailed it
